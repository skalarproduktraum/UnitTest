# UnitTest
UnitTest is a lean unit testing framework for Mathematica.

# Requirements
* UnitTest is usable (read: tested) with Mathematica 7 and up - it may or may not work with older versions

# License
UnitTest is available under the very permissive MIT license, which means you can use it for whatever you want, you do not need to pay me, but if you need to leave the licensing information intact if you use my code. Lawyers rejoice: There is also a file called LICENSE in this package with all the lawyer-y stuff.
